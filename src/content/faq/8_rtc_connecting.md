Cause is unknown, so there is no real fix.

However, a simple workaround that fixes it temporarily is to click the text that says RTC Connecting, then click Debug. Close the page that opens again and it should now be fixed!

Note that you need Discord Developer Mode (Discord Settings > Advanced > Developer Mode) enabled to do this!
